# This script will ingest data from HANA to your laptop. It also performs some initial preprocessing of the data.  #
# Parts of the script are coded for you - the numbered exercises are meant for you to practise.                    #
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# We'll start by loading the libraries we're going to need. Please use install.packages("<package_name>") the first 
# time you're using a package. After that, you can simply use library(<package_name>) as below.
library(RODBC)
library(odbc)
library(stringr)

# ===== Set up connection and run query ===== #
# Using the odbc libraries, we will set up a connection to hana as follows. The name you filled in should correspond
# to the DSN name in data source manager.
# you may need to add uid and pw arguments to the below function for it to work. 
con <- RODBC::odbcConnect("HANA")

# Now the connection is set up, we can query the database using a SQL statement. 
# Check out the below query. Note the "\" to escape quotes inside quotes. It will take a minute for the query to run.
sell_thru = sqlQuery(con, "SELECT sales_org, postal_cd, sold_to_desc, fiscal_week_begin, net_management_sales_usd FROM _SYS_BIC.\"BOSE.MPE_SALES/MPE_CAV_SALES_SALESACTUALS_SELLTHROUGH\" where SALES_ORG='US10'")

# Check out the data you have just retrieved (do not open sell_in entirely - R will crash).
head(sell_thru)

# EX 1. Some postal codes have more than 5 characters. Show the different number of characters that the postal_cd field is made out of.     



# EX 2. Clean up the POSTAL_CD field to always consist of the first 5 characters. Hint: Use substr().



# EX 3. Now exclude the zips with length 0.



# We want all zips to be of length 5. Here we use padding to add trailing 0's to zip codes of length < 5.
sell_thru$POSTAL_CD = str_pad(sell_thru$POSTAL_CD, 5, pad="0")

# EX 4. SOLD_TO_DESC includes all resellers. Transform the field to split out "BB", transform any other values to "RSL". 
# (Hint: use ifelse() or case_when() on the SOLD_TO_DESC field).



# ===== Retrieve sell-in data ===== #
sell_in = sqlQuery(con, "SELECT net_mangement_sales_usd, postal_cd, sales_org, sales_off, fiscal_week_begin FROM _SYS_BIC.\"BOSE.MPE_SALES/MPE_CAV_SALES_DIRECT_SELLIN\" where SALES_ORG ='US10' AND sales_off IN ('4003','4010')")

# EX 5. check out sell_in .



# EX 6. Use same procedure as above for sell-thru to clean up zip codes.



# ===== Now we want to join the two data sets ===== # 
# EX 7. Make sure the sell-in data frame has a column "channel" that indicates which channel the results apply to.




# EX 8. Strip column SALES_OFF as we do not need it anymore now we have channel .




# EX 9. Make sure both data frames have the same column names. Hint: use colnames().




# EX 10. Join the two dataframes by using rbind() ("rowbind").




# EX 11. Write the results to a local csv file. Hint: use write.csv().
