# There will be only one practice exercise in this module: 
# As we all know, Covid-19 has impacted our sales dramatically in the last month. Let's suppose our current sales figures for BBY are the new baseline. 
# Try to guide the Prophet model to use the most current sales baseline to forecast the next 52 weeks. Do this by adjusting the parameters in the model. 

# Some tips: 
# We could manually add changepoint dates. 
# Explore using different seasonality models. (do we expect high season sales to be additive or multiplicative?)
# A non-linear trend specification and setting bounds could help us in not diving below 0 sales. 
# Could try out modelling on transformed sales columns?
